# Blobber Royale!
The one and only game that features sumo fighting blobs! It's the blobber-dome: two blobs enter, one blob leaves! Appease the blob gods with ritual combat, and may the blobs be ever in your favor!

The twist is that you have to control your blob with your voice; shout at it (up, down, left, right) and knock your opponent out of the arena! Normal key presses are still turned on for easy testing, but they'll be deactivated when it's finally Blobbering Time.

### Bugs and Weird Things

Voice recognition controls are still not quite perfect; it lags, and isn't as reliable as we would like it to be. Currently, only two players are supported, but we are going to scale it up, which shouldn't be too difficult with sockets. Same for game instances; right now only a single instance runs, but we can scale that up as well.
